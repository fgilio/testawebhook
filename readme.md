# Test a Webhook
Easily test any Webhook.

## Instructions

Just open https://testawebhook.com and you will be redirected to your own Webhook testing endpoint.
You can copy and use that URL anywhere. Test a Webhook will catch any non GET request made to that URL and display it for you.

## Why?

There are many other Webhook testing services similar to this, and many are more feature complete. But I feel that none of those gets the mix of simplicity, usefulness and prettiness just right. With Test a Webhook I aim at doing just that.  
Working on Test a Webhook I also have the opportunity to use Caleb's [Livewire](https://livewire-framework.com/). I you don't know about it, it's a framework for Laravel that allows you to build dynamic front-ends by writing only PHP. Check it out, it's [amazing](https://livewire-framework.com/)
